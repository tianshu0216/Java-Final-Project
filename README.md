The document is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the system's structure, the technologies utilized, and the interaction between various modules and user types. It serves as a roadmap for the development team, stakeholders, and reviewers, offering insights into the platform's core functionalities, database design, and the integration of different layers of the application.
